Return ONLY the Databricks Asset Bundle YAML (databricks.yml) as plain text.
Use notebook tasks and preserve dependencies based on the mapping payloads.
Use placeholders for workspace values (no secrets).
Keep it minimal: only jobs/tasks for the mapped DAGs.
Only include libraries if notebooks explicitly require them.
Do NOT add extra tags, parameters, or clusters beyond essentials.
Use notebook paths that match the generated files:
$${workspace.root_path}/notebooks/<dag_id>/<notebook_name>
$no_inference_rules

Project name: $project_name
Requirements summary: $requirements_summary
Index payloads: $index_payloads
Mapping payloads: $mapping_payloads
