Generate a Databricks notebook (.py) for this task.
Notebook must start with "# Databricks notebook source" and include "# COMMAND ----------" separators
between logical sections (at least one COMMAND separator).
Return JSON only: {"content_base64": "base64 string"}.
Use standard base64 without newlines.
Keep it minimal and strictly match the DAG task intent.
Do NOT add extra steps (DQ, watermarking, schema normalization, logging frameworks).
Only include Spark/JDBC/Snowflake logic if the DAG task explicitly performs I/O.
If the DAG task is a PythonOperator that only prints/logs, use print() only.
Use widgets only if the task has explicit parameters.
If callable_snippet is provided and only contains print/log statements, mirror those statements.
$no_inference_rules
If mapping payloads include pdf_text or requirements_summary starting with "PDF ONLY", follow the PDF instructions
even if DAG callables only print.
