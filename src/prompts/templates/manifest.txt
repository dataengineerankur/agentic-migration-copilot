Create a compact generation manifest. Return JSON only.
Include notebook list with dag_id + notebook_name + purpose.
Only include notebooks that correspond 1:1 with the DAG tasks.
Use task_id as the notebook_name (e.g., task_id + ".py") unless a different name is explicitly required.
Only include utils if a notebook explicitly needs shared helper(s).
Prefer zero utils for simple DAGs (e.g., PythonOperator with print-only logic).
Avoid extra files, scaffolding, or frameworks not required by the DAG.
$no_inference_rules
If mapping payloads include pdf_text or requirements_summary starting with "PDF ONLY", use the PDF instructions
to define notebook purpose and content even if DAG callables are print-only.
