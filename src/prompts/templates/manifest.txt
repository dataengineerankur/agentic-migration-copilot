Create a compact generation manifest. Return JSON only.
Include notebook list with dag_id + notebook_name + purpose.
Only include notebooks that are required to implement the DAG.
You may group multiple tasks into a single notebook; in that case list task_ids.
Only include utils if a notebook explicitly needs shared helper(s).
Prefer zero utils for simple DAGs (e.g., PythonOperator with print-only logic).
Avoid extra files, scaffolding, or frameworks not required by the DAG.
$no_inference_rules
If mapping payloads include pdf_text or requirements_summary starting with "PDF ONLY", use the PDF instructions
to define notebook purpose and content even if DAG callables are print-only.
